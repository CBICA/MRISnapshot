Installation/Usage:
*******************
As the package has not been published on PyPi yet, it CANNOT be install using pip.

For now, the suggested method is to put the file `simpleble.py` in the same directory as your source files and call ``from simpleble import SimpleBleClient, SimpleBleDevice``.

``bluepy`` must also be installed and imported as shown in the example below.
For instructions about how to install, as well as the full documentation of, ``bluepy`` please refer `here <https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy/>`_
